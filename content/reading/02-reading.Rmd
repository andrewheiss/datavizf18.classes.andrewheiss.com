# Questions to reflect on

- How do these types of visualizations help or hinder or search for truth in data?
- Why are pie charts and curved lines generally unacceptable? When are pie and donut charts acceptable?
- What are different ways to show the variability of a single number? Are some more appropriate than others? Why?
