# Questions to reflect on

**Important!** The memo for this last week is a little different. Write **150â€“200** words about the storytelling readings, and then write **400ish** words exploring a few of these summative questions:

- What is truth?
- How do we find truth?
- Are facts truth?
- What's the difference between content and form?
- Does beauty matter when describing truth?
- How does any of this philosophical humanities stuff relate to data visualization?
