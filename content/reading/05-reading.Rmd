# Questions to reflect on

- In chapter 3, Evergreen provides a ton of new ways to present comparisons. Which ones are your favorite? Which ones didn't quite click with you? In what situations are some more appropriate than others?
- Do combo charts and bullet graphs break the rule against double y-axes? Why or why not?
