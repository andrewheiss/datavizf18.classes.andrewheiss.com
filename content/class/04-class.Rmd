# US birth data

Here's the data I used:

- <i class="fas fa-table"></i> [Data from the CDC and SSA (via FiveThirtyEight)](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births)

Here's a more complete version of the code I wrote in class:

- <i class="fas fa-code"></i> [`birth-plots.Rmd`](/files/birth-plots.Rmd)
- <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> [The complete RStudio project](/files/births.zip)
- <i class="fas fa-globe"></i> The knitted [`birth-plots.html`](/files/birth-plots.html)


# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/rSIbw1voOV2vWKMD2) and answer these two questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.


```{r class-stuff, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

dogs <- rnorm(1000, mean = 40, sd = 10)
hist(dogs)

cats_house <- rnorm(500, mean = 20, sd = 5)
cats_wild <- rnorm(500, mean = 60, sd = 5)
animals <- tribble(
  ~animal, ~weight,
  "Dogs",  rnorm(1000, mean = 40, sd = 10),
  "Cats",  c(rnorm(500, mean = 20, sd = 5), rnorm(500, mean = 60, sd = 5))
) %>% 
  unnest(weight)

animals_plot <- animals %>% 
  group_by(animal) %>% 
  summarize(weight = mean(weight))

ggplot(animals_plot, aes(x = animal, y = weight)) +
  geom_col()

ggplot(animals, aes(x = animal, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter", size = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", size = 5, color = "darkred") #+ 
  # stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2)
```
