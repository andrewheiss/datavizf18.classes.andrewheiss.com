I've saved the R script to Dropbox, and that link goes to a live version of that file. Refresh or re-open the link as needed to copy/paste code I type up on the screen.


# Louisville animal bites

Use some of this code to help you get started. You don't have to do this—this gets a count of dog, cat, and other bites between 2010 and 2017. Feel free to do whatever you want. You're iterating here!

```{r bites-clean, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

bites_raw <- read_csv("data/Health_AnimalBites.csv")

# Or directly from the internet if you want
# bites_raw <- read_csv("https://datavizf18.classes.andrewheiss.com/data/Health_AnimalBites.csv")

bites <- bites_raw %>%
  mutate(year = year(bite_date)) %>%
  mutate(species = case_when(
    SpeciesIDDesc == "CAT" ~ "Cat",
    SpeciesIDDesc == "DOG" ~ "Dog",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) %>% 
  mutate(species = factor(species, levels = c("Dog", "Cat", "Other"), ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(year < 2018, year >= 2010) 

bites_species_year <- bites %>%
  filter(!is.na(species)) %>%
  group_by(year, species) %>%
  summarize(total_bites = n())
```


# Iterative design + grouping and annotating

Here are some fairly polished plots based on the world happiness index and other UN and World Bank data, all arranged in a nice 3-panel figure with patchwork. This is the final output—the process of getting to the point took a while and went through lots of different iterations, which is the creative process in action.

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(broom)  # For dealing with models as data frames
library(patchwork)
library(ggbeeswarm)  # For cool dot plots
```

```{r fake-load-data, eval=FALSE}
happiness <- read_csv("data/world_happiness.csv")
```

```{r real-load-data, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
happiness <- read_csv(here::here("static", "data", "world_happiness.csv"))
```

```{r manipulate-data}
happiness_clean <- happiness %>% 
  mutate(in_asia = region == "East Asia & Pacific") %>% 
  mutate(label_to_plot = ifelse(in_asia, country, NA)) %>% 
  mutate(region_big = case_when(
    region == "East Asia & Pacific" ~ "Asia",
    region == "Europe & Central Asia" ~ "Europe",
    region == "Latin America & Caribbean" ~ "North & South America",
    region == "North America" ~ "North & South America",
    region == "South Asia" ~ "Asia",
    TRUE ~ region
  )) %>% 
  mutate(region_big = factor(region_big, 
                             levels = c("North & South America", "Europe", 
                                        "Middle East & North Africa", "Asia", 
                                        "Sub-Saharan Africa"), 
                             ordered = TRUE))
```

## Happiness explained by life expectancy

Here's the relationship between life expectancy and national happiness, with East Asian and Oceanic countries highlighted with redundant shapes. Note how instead of using `annotate()`, I make a separate data frame called `extra_labels` and then use `geom_text()` to plot it twice. This might be overkill here, since I'm only plotting two things, but it allows for more flexibility later if I want to add additional labels and not worry about adding even more `annotate()` layers.

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r plot1, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
extra_labels <- tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~text, ~align,
  Inf, -Inf, "Longer life", "right",
  -Inf, Inf, "Happier country", "left"
)

plot1 <- ggplot(happiness_clean, aes(x = life_expectancy, y = happiness_score)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = in_asia, shape = in_asia)) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = label_to_plot), nudge_x = 1, nudge_y = 0.25, force = 50,
                   arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "lines")), alpha = 0.75,
                   point.padding = 0.5, seed = 12345) +
  geom_text(data = filter(extra_labels, align == "right"), 
            aes(x = x, y = y, label = text),
            hjust = "right", vjust = -1, color = "grey50", fontface = "italic") +
  geom_text(data = filter(extra_labels, align == "left"), 
            aes(x = x, y = y, label = text),
            hjust = "left", vjust = 1, color = "grey50", fontface = "italic") +
  # annotate(geom = "text", x = 70, y = 5, label = "HEY", fontface = "bold", size = 15) +
  labs(x = "Life expectancy (years)", y = "Happiness score",
       title = "Relationship between life expectancy and national happiness",
       subtitle = "East Asia and Oceania highlighted") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("grey40", "darkred")) +
  guides(color = FALSE, shape = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(b = 20)))
plot1
```

## Happiness explained by life expectancy, colored by region

Here I collapsed some of the regions with `case_when()` up above, and then generated a palette of five perceptually uniform and colorblind friendly colors at [iWantHue](http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/). 

The other cool thing about this plot is `final_predicted_points`, which runs a linear regression model on each region and then determines the final predicted point for each line, which I then use with `geom_text_repel()` to put region names directly on the plot.

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r plot2, fig.width=10, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
final_predicted_points <- happiness_clean %>% 
  # Look at each region
  group_by(region_big) %>% 
  # Put a miniature data frame inside a cell for each region
  nest() %>% 
  # Run a simple regression model on each of those nested data frames
  mutate(model = data %>% map(~ lm(happiness_score ~ life_expectancy, data = .))) %>% 
  # Use augment() to calculate the fitted values from each model
  mutate(fitted = model %>% map(~ augment(.))) %>% 
  # Spread out the nested data frame
  unnest(fitted) %>% 
  # Select the first row in each of the fitted values, which is the last row
  group_by(region_big) %>% 
  arrange(desc(life_expectancy)) %>% 
  slice(1)

plot2 <- ggplot(happiness_clean, 
                aes(x = life_expectancy, y = happiness_score, color = region_big)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = region_big)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_text_repel(data = final_predicted_points, 
                  aes(x = life_expectancy, y = .fitted, label = region_big), 
                  nudge_x = 5, direction = "y", hjust = "left", size = 4) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(50, 80, 10)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#b84c7d", "#56ae6c", "#7f63b8", "#ac9c3d", "#ba543d")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 17, 16, 15, 8)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 100)) +
  guides(color = FALSE, shape = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Life expectancy (years)", y = "Happiness score",
       title = "Trends in life expectancy by region") +
  theme_minimal(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)))
plot2
```

</figure>

## Happiness by region

Here I just plot happiness scores (i.e. no comparison with life expectancy or anything else) by region. I use `geom_quasirandom()` from [the `ggbeeswarm` package](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm), which jitters points in cool shapes. 

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r plot3, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
plot3 <- ggplot(happiness_clean, 
                aes(x = fct_rev(region_big), y = happiness_score, color = region_big)) +
  geom_quasirandom(aes(shape = region_big), width = 0.2) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#b84c7d", "#56ae6c", "#7f63b8", "#ac9c3d", "#ba543d")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 17, 16, 15, 8)) +
  guides(color = FALSE, shape = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Happiness score", title = "Happiness scores by region") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)))
plot3
```

</figure>

## Combined mega plot with patchwork

Finally, I put all of these together in a final combined plot using [the `patchwork` package](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork).

Note how I make some adjustments to `plot1`, `plot2`, and `plot2`, like shrinking the titles and adding tags. Also note that I use `/` and `+` and `*` and `&` to combine the plots in the right configuration. I figured this out by reading the README at `patchwork`'s GitHub repository.

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r combined, fig.width=12, fig.height=9, warning=FALSE}
plot1_to_combine <- plot1 +
  labs(tag = "A")

plot2_to_combine <- plot2 +
  labs(tag = "B")

plot3_to_combine <- plot3 +
  labs(tag = "C")

final_plot <- plot1_to_combine / 
  ((plot2_to_combine + plot3_to_combine) + plot_layout(widths = c(0.7, 0.3))) & 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1)),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = rel(0.9)),
        plot.tag = element_text(color = "grey50"),
        axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0))
final_plot
```

# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/rSIbw1voOV2vWKMD2) and answer these two questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
