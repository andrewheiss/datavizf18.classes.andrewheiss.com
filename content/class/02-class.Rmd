# Quick redesign

Choose one of these on-campus fliers and redesign it in a small group:

- BYU Student Wellness: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> All assets](/files/byu-student-wellness.zip)
- Safe Kids Utah County: [<i class="fas fa-file-archive"></i> All assets](/files/safe-kids.zip)


# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/rSIbw1voOV2vWKMD2) and answer these two questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
