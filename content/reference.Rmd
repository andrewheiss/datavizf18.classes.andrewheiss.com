# How to select the appropriate chart type

[^dataviz-cat] Many people have created many useful tools for selecting the correct chart type for a given dataset or question. Here are some of the best:

- [**The Data Visualisation Catalogue**](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/): Descriptions, explanations, examples, and tools for creating 60 different types of visualizations.
- [**The Data Viz Project**](http://datavizproject.com/): Descriptions and examples for 150 different types of visualizations. Also allows you to search by data shape and chart function (comparison, correlation, distribution, geographical, part to whole, trend over time, etc.).

# Visualization in Tableau

Because it is focused entirely on visualization (and because it's a well-supported commercial product), Tableau has a [phenomenal library of tutorials and training videos](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training). There's [a helpful collections of videos here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-video-tutorials-for-learning-Tableau), as well.


# Working with R and ggplot2

- [^r-google] [**Kieran Healy, *Data Visualization for Social Science: A practical introduction with R and ggplot2***](http://socviz.co/): This is a new, still-in-draft book that provides excellent examples and tutorials about how to create graphics with R and ggplot2.
- [**Stat 545**](http://stat545.com/): [Dr. Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) at the University of British Columbia has an entire introductory course in R, visualization, and data analysis online.

[^r-google]: {-} *Pro-tip*: Searching for help with R on Google can be tricky because the program is, um, a single letter. Try searching for "rstats" instead. If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats). The R community on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also incredibly kind and helpful.


# R in the wild

A popular (and increasingly standard) way for sharing your analyses and visualizations is to post an annotated explanation of your process somewhere online. RStudio allows you to publish knitted HTML files directly to [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/), but you can also post your output to a blog or other type of website.^[{-} If you want to be really fancy, you can use [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which makes a complete website with R Markdown files. That's actually how this site is built ([see the source code](https://github.com/andrewheiss/dataviz.andrewheiss.com)). You can build your own site [with this tutorial](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/).] Reading these kinds of posts is one of the best ways to learn R, since they walk you through each step of the process *and* show the code and output.

Here are some of the best examples I've come across:

- [Text analysis of Trump's tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) (with a [follow-up](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-followup/))
